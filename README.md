# Vue Museum Booking App

This is the repository for the "Vue Museum Booking App," a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) project. This application demonstrates how to build a museum booking system using Vue.js and the Timerise API.

## Tutorial

For a detailed guide on how this application was built, visit our tutorial: [Building a Museum Booking App with Vue.js and Timerise API](https://timerise.io/tutorial-building-a-museum-booking-app-with-vue-js-and-timerise-api/). The tutorial covers everything from setting up the project to deploying it with Vercel, making it a great resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
